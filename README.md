# Stroke Detection Model

- **Objective**: Build a model to predict the likelihood of stroke based on various medical features.
- **Data**: Uses a dataset with information like age, hypertension, heart disease, etc.
- **Preprocessing**:
  - Filled missing values.
  - Encoded categorical features.
  - Split data into training and testing sets.
  - Use SMOTE for oversampling.
- **Modeling**:
  - Comparing logistic regression, decision trees, and random forest models.
  - Evaluated model using accuracy and F1-score.
- **Results**:
  - Achieved an accuracy of around 95%.
- **Conclusion**: The random forest model shows promising results for stroke prediction.
